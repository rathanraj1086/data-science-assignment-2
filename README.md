# "Predicting stress using wearable sensors (Nurses)"

The Project aim is to create a wearable biometric nursing stress dataset that can facilitate the development of early detection algorithms for work-related stress.

•	**Advice** : The study is titled with “ [A multi-modal sensor dataset for continuous stress detection of nurses in a hospital](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.5hqbzkh6f) ” You can read  all the details of the experiment and the methods and usage notes in study article.

•	**Dataset** : The zip file holds the data of 15 participants in different folders. Each folder contains raw data signals in CSV format in a sub-folder. A raw data folder consists of 6 different CSV files, including (1) EDA.csv (electrodermal activity), (2) HR.csv (heart rate), (3) TEMP.csv (skin temperature), (4) IBI.csv (inter-beat interval), (5) BVP.csv (blood volume pulse), and (6) ACC.csv (accelerometer data).

**[Nurses_2202481.ipynb](https://github.com/rathanraj1086/data-science-assignment-2/blob/main/Nurses_2202481.ipynb)**: Data understanding, data preprocessing, feature selection, model training/testing, and model evaluation are all included in the project's detailed code execution in Jupytor Notebook.

**[Maincode.py](https://github.com/rathanraj1086/data-science-assignment-2/blob/main/maincode.py)**:  The most accurate model, which uses all the files for Data preprocessing, Feature Selection, Model Training and Model Evaluation is coded in a python file.
